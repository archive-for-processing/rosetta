# Rosetta
Traductor App from Processing to OpenFrameworks

This is an App for transtale Processing code into OpenFrameworks code, with syntaxis highlight in real-time. Only support Processing static mode (active mode's support will be added in the future). The use of vars isn't full support yet (better don't use it, will be added soon).

This software is not intended for the translation of large Processing projects to OpenFrameworks. It is recommended to use it like a support tool, and not like a precise traductor.
